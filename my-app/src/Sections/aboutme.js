                I'm Kinton Duong, a student at UC Berkeley majoring in Computer Science and Data Science interested in the intersection between tech and human cognition. 
                Outside of school, I love to make beats, watch sports, and try new foods. A big part of my life growing up was playing water polo, and even though I am not
                playing competively anymore, the grit, leadership, and dedication will always be instilled in me. Feel free to click on the pages to learn more about my technical experiences and interests.
