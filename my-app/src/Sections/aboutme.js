                I'm Kinton Duong, a student at UC Berkeley majoring in Computer Science and Data Science interested in the intersection between tech and human cognition. 
                Outside of school, I love to make beats, watch sports, and try new foods. Feel free to click on the pages to learn more about my technical experiences and interests.
